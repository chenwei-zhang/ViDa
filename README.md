# ViDa: a visualization tool for DNA reaction trajectories

we proposed a new approach, that we named **ViDa**, to visualize DNA reaction trajectories. We use the Multistrand simulator to generate reaction trajectories, and then adopte the GSAE model, combing with PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and PHATE algorithms to map high-dimensional double-stranded DNA secondary structures from DNA reaction trajectories to 2-D Euclidean space, followed by laying out the trajectories on the energy landscape. We also designed a interactive plotting tool to display the corresponding information of each state, such as dot-parenthesis notation of secondary structures, free energy and holding time, by hovering the mouse.

Some interactive plots can be accessed by this link:
